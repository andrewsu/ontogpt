Sly syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS-VII),
is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency
of the enzyme Î²-glucuronidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down
large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (AKA GAGs, or mucopolysaccharides).
The inability to break down GAGs leads to a buildup in many tissues and organs of the body.
The severity of the disease can vary widely.
