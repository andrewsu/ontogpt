Hubbard Brook and measured the response of fine root biomass fourteen years after treatment.  
Fine root samples were collected in Watershed 1 and the Bear Brook Watershed reference forest, located to the west
of Watershed 6, in 1998 (pre-Ca treatment) and in 2013. In this northern hardwood forest fine root 
(< 1 mm diameter) biomass declined significantly in the Ca addition treatment relative to pretreatment and 
reference forest conditions.  The decline was greatest in the high-elevation hardwood zone of the watershed where soils are
thinnest and most base poor.  In that zone fine roots were distributed more shallowly after 
treatment than for reference conditions.  We suggest that relatively higher tree C allocation to roots contributes to 
depressed aboveground productivity in acidified northern hardwood forest ecosystems."
