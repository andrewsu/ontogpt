To quantify the magnitude of soil nitrous oxide flux and the drivers
of nitrous oxide emissions in a representative central Iowa
corn-soybean agricultural system, we measured greenhouse gas
emissions (N2O and
CO2) from 2017 to 2019 (primarily using
custom automated chambers) along with soil chemical and physical
parameters across a topographic gradient in a typically managed
agricultural field near Ames, Iowa, USA. More details can be found
in the associated manuscript, Lawrence et al. (2021).
